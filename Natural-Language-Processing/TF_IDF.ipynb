    "| **1️⃣ Word Weighting** | Assigns higher weights to informative words and lower weights to common ones. | Common but contextually important words (like “you”, “your”) may be underweighted. | For “lottery”: $$ TFIDF_{\\text{lottery}} = 0.2 \\times \\log_e\\!\\left(\\frac{2}{1}\\right) = 0.1386 $$ <br> → high importance |\n",
    "| **2️⃣ Frequency Sensitivity** | Captures how often a word appears in a sentence. | Fails to account for **semantic meaning** — only counts occurrences. | $$ TF_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$ but meaning of “free” not understood. |\n",
    "| **3️⃣ Global Rarity (IDF)** | Down-weights words that appear in many sentences. | If the dataset is small, IDF can over-penalize frequent words. | $$ IDF_{\\text{free}} = \\log_e\\!\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right)=0 $$ → common word ignored |\n",
    "| **4️⃣ Simplicity & Efficiency** | Easy to implement; interpretable numeric representation. | Ignores word order and context (bag-of-words assumption). | “Win a free ticket” vs “Free ticket win” → same vector. |\n",
    "| **5️⃣ Dimensionality** | Works well with linear models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM). | High dimensional & sparse; memory intensive for large vocabularies. | Sparse matrix $$ X_{\\text{TFIDF}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times M} $$ where $ N $=docs, $ M $=vocab size |\n",
    "| **6️⃣ Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV)** | Learns vocabulary directly from training data. | Cannot handle unseen words — new tokens get ignored (weight = 0). | Training vocab: {\"lottery\", \"free\"} → Test msg: \"jackpot alert\" → both OOV → $$ TFIDF_{\\text{jackpot}} = 0 $$ |\n",
    "| **7️⃣ Use in Spam Detection** | Highlights strong spam indicators (e.g., “lottery”, “claim”, “winner”). | Cannot capture negation or sarcasm without additional features. | “Not a lottery” → may still trigger high TF-IDF for “lottery”. |\n",
