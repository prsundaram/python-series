    "### üéØ Final Summary: Context Managers in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The `with` Statement (Built-in)\n",
    "- Simplest form of context manager, often used with files.\n",
    "- Ensures resources (like files) are **automatically cleaned up** after use.\n",
    "- Equivalent to writing `try/finally` blocks manually, but shorter and safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Class-Based Context Managers\n",
    "- Define `__enter__()` for setup (resource allocation).\n",
    "- Define `__exit__()` for cleanup (resource release).\n",
    "- Gives full control over resource management, including handling exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Function-Based Context Managers (`@contextmanager`)\n",
    "- Use `contextlib.contextmanager` and `yield` for a simpler syntax.\n",
    "- Code before `yield` ‚Üí setup.\n",
    "- Code after `yield` ‚Üí cleanup.\n",
    "- More concise than writing classes, especially for simple managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Why Context Managers?\n",
    "- They eliminate the need for **manual cleanup** (like `close()`).\n",
    "- Guarantee cleanup happens even if an **exception occurs**.\n",
    "- Make code more **readable, concise, and reliable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Multiple Context Managers\n",
    "- Allows opening/using **multiple resources** in a single `with` statement.\n",
    "- Ensures **all resources** are closed properly when the block exits.\n",
    "- Cleaner than writing nested `with` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Suppressing Exceptions (`suppress`)\n",
    "- Lets you **ignore specific exceptions** automatically.\n",
    "- Useful when certain errors are expected (e.g., file may not exist).\n",
    "- Prevents unnecessary `try/except` clutter in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. ExitStack\n",
    "- Advanced tool for managing a **dynamic or unknown number of resources**.\n",
    "- You can add resources as needed (`enter_context`).\n",
    "- Automatically closes all resources at the end of the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Async Context Managers (`async with`)\n",
    "- Used in asynchronous programming with `async/await`.\n",
    "- Ensures async resources (like DB connections, network sockets) are setup/cleaned properly.\n",
    "- Essential in frameworks like **FastAPI, aiohttp, async DB drivers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway\n",
    "Context managers = **automatic setup + cleanup**.  \n",
    "They:\n",
    "- Simplify resource handling,\n",
    "- Prevent memory/resource leaks,\n",
    "- Work in both synchronous and asynchronous worlds,\n",
    "- Scale from simple file handling ‚Üí to advanced use cases (DBs, threads, APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Context managers are everywhere in Python ‚Äî mastering them makes your code **cleaner, safer, and more professional**.\n"
