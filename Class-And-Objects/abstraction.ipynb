    "## üîç What is Abstraction?\n",
    "- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features.\n",
    "- It allows developers to focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "- Achieved in Python using Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods from the abc module.\n",
    "# üéØ Key Characteristics of Abstraction\n",
    "- An Abstract Class is like a blueprint:\n",
    "- It can define abstract methods (declared but not implemented).\n",
    "- It may also contain concrete methods (normal methods with implementation).\n",
    "- A subclass must implement all abstract methods, otherwise it cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "- This enforces a contract for all subclasses.\n",
    "# üß∫ Real-World Analogies & Examples\n",
    "1. Washing Machine\n",
    "    - User presses Start button ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt know how the drum spins, water fills, or motor runs.\n",
    "    - Different washing machines (Eco, Turbo) may implement washing, rinsing, spinning differently.\n",
    "    - Abstraction point: User only sees start(), not the internal steps.\n",
    "2. Payment Gateway\n",
    "    - Business calls a method like charge() or refund().\n",
    "    - Whether it‚Äôs Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal, each implements its own internal logic.\n",
    "    - Abstraction point: The interface (charge, refund) is the same, the implementation differs.\n",
    "## üîë Benefits of Abstraction\n",
    "- Hides unnecessary complexity from the user.\n",
    "- Provides a clear and consistent interface.\n",
    "- Makes code modular and maintainable.\n",
    "- Enables polymorphism ‚Üí same method names, different implementations.\n",
    "- Improves reusability ‚Üí logic can be swapped easily (e.g., switch from LocalStore to S3Store).\n",
    "# üìã Abstraction vs Encapsulation\n",
    "- Encapsulation ‚Üí about data hiding (restrict direct access using public/protected/private).\n",
    "- Abstraction ‚Üí about hiding implementation details and exposing only the interface.\n",
    "- Encapsulation is at the implementation level, abstraction is at the design level.\n",
    "## üîë Key Takeaways: Abstraction in Python\n",
    "- Abstraction = Hide implementation, show only essential features.\n",
    "- Achieved in Python using Abstract Classes (ABC) and Abstract Methods (@abstractmethod).\n",
    "- Abstract classes act as a blueprint ‚Üí subclasses must implement the required methods.\n",
    "- Focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "- Promotes polymorphism ‚Üí different classes implement the same interface in their own way.\n",
    "- Real-world examples:\n",
    "    - Washing Machine ‚Üí user presses start(), internals are hidden.\n",
    "    - Payment Gateway ‚Üí charge()/refund() same interface, different providers.\n",
    "- Improves code modularity, maintainability, and reusability."
